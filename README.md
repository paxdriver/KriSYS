PGP Implementation Details

Blockchain Admin Authentication


The system uses a dual-layer admin authentication approach:


1. 
Master Keypair Generation: When blockchain initializes, generates 4096-bit RSA keypair


	- Public Key: Stored in blockchain/master_public_key.asc
	- Private Key: Stored in blockchain/master_private_key.asc
	- Used for admin API authentication and wallet key encryption
2. 
Admin API Access: Development admin requests use base64-encoded master private key

# Backend validates by decoding and comparing full key
decoded_token = base64.b64decode(auth_token).decode('utf8')
if decoded_token != ADMIN_TOKEN: # ADMIN_TOKEN is full PGP private key

User Wallet Encryption (Dual-Layer Security)


The wallet system implements dual-layer encryption to protect user messages while allowing simple passphrase recovery:


1. 
Wallet Creation Process:

# 1. Generate user PGP keypair with user's passphrase
user_keypair = generate_keypair(user_passphrase)

# 2. User's private key is encrypted with their passphrase
user_encrypted_key = str(user_keypair)  # Already encrypted by PGP

# 3. Encrypt the encrypted key again with blockchain master key
master_encrypted_key = master_public_key.encrypt(user_encrypted_key)

# 4. Store only the double-encrypted key
database.store(family_id, master_encrypted_key, user_keypair.pubkey)



2. 
Wallet Unlock Process:
# 1. Server decrypts with master private key (never stores result)
user_encrypted_key = master_private_key.decrypt(stored_key)

# 2. Send encrypted key to client
return user_encrypted_key  # Still encrypted with user passphrase

# 3. Client decrypts with passphrase for message reading
actual_private_key = decrypt_with_passphrase(user_encrypted_key, passphrase)


3. 
Message Encryption Flow:

- Sending: Client encrypts with recipient's public key using KeyManager
- Receiving: Client decrypts with own private key (unlocked with passphrase)
- Server Role: Only stores/delivers encrypted content, never decrypts messages


This design ensures:

- Admin Access: Blockchain admin can decrypt wallet keys for recovery but cannot read messages
- User Privacy: Only user's passphrase can decrypt their messages
- Simple Recovery: Users only need to remember one passphrase
- Offline Capability: Private keys cached locally after first unlock



Quick Start
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd krisys

# Start development environment
docker-compose up --build

# Access applications
# React Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Flask API: http://localhost:5000

# Development workflow
# 1. Create a family wallet with passphrase
# 2. Unlock wallet to enable message decryption
# 3. Send encrypted messages between family members
# 4. Use DevTools to manually mine blocks
# 5. View messages decrypt in real-time

- GET /crisis - Current crisis information
- POST /wallet - Create family wallet
- POST /transaction - Submit transaction
- POST /checkin - QR code check-in

Wallet Management

- GET /wallet/{family_id} - Wallet info (no keys)
- GET /wallet/{family_id}/transactions - Transaction history
- GET /wallet/{family_id}/public-key - Public key for encryption
- POST /auth/unlock - Authenticate and retrieve private key

Admin Controls

- POST /admin/mine - Manual block mining

Security Model

Development Environment

- Empty passphrases accepted for rapid testing
- CORS enabled for localhost development
- Base64-encoded admin tokens
- Rate limiting can be disabled via DevTools

Production Considerations

- Passphrase Requirements: Minimum 8+ character requirement
- HTTPS/TLS: All API communication encrypted
- Admin Key Rotation: Secure master key management
- Rate Limiting: Transaction frequency controls
- Key Revocation: Mechanism for compromised key recovery

Privacy Protection

- No PII on Blockchain: Only addresses and encrypted content
- Local Contact Storage: Names stored only on user device
- Wallet Locking: Contact names hidden when wallet locked
- Message Obfuscation: All personal communications encrypted

Technology Stack

- Backend: Python 3.11, Flask, SQLite, pgpy (PGP), QR code generation
- Frontend: React 18, Next.js 14, OpenPGP.js, Custom CSS
- Deployment: Docker containers with shared volume
- Development: No TypeScript, no CSS frameworks for simplicity

Crisis Response Workflow

1. Crisis Setup: Aid organization deploys KriSYS instance with crisis-specific policy
2. Family Registration: Families create wallets, receive QR codes for members
3. Deployment: QR scanners installed at aid stations, shelters, medical facilities
4. Active Response:
	- Families check in via QR codes at various locations
	- Emergency alerts broadcast to all registered families
	- Private coordination via encrypted family messages
	- Resource tracking and supply distribution management
5. Recovery Phase: Damage assessment reports and long-term coordination
