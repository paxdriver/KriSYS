# July 30 2025: Phase 2 progress checks
# Wallet Creation: Create a family wallet and verify it is stored with the correct crisis context.
# Transaction Types:
# 	- Check-in: Simulate a station checking in a family member.
# 	- User Message: Send a message from one user to another (should be PGP encrypted).
# 	- Admin Alert: Send a plaintext alert from an admin account (should be readable by all).
# 	- Damage Report: Send a damage report from a station.
# Policy Enforcement:
# 	- Verify that transactions exceeding size limits are rejected.
# 	- Verify rate limiting per station.
# 	- Verify priority levels are enforced.
